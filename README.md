# Graph and Routes
... contains graph creation systems and movement in the created graphs.

## Graph creation
for the graph creation multiple generators can be used. 

### Regular Network
Draw or upload a shape with an indicator color (red, color code: ) and see the program inserting a regular shaped 
network of nodes and edges. 

### Convex Hull
Insert new nodes into a canvas and see the graph connecting to these nodes automatically. The overall shape of the 
created body will be worked out as a convex hull. 

### Equal sized mesh
Draw or upload a shape with an indicator color (red, color code: ) and insert the desired pixel or node size. The 
program will create a mesh within the body to fit the conditions/restrictions. 

## Routing in graphs
There are several routing algorithms to find paths between two points.
